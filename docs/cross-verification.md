# Cross-verification previews

Cross-verification is an optional wrapper-owned layer over the two independent
generalist discovery passes and convention-specialist discovery. It is disabled
unless `-EnableVerificationPreview` or `review.verification.enabled` is set.
It never changes the generalist union, summary, delivery comments, state, or vote.

## Inputs and replay

The wrapper seals a `verification-input-preview` artifact containing:

- each raw generalist marker, model ID, and SHA-256;
- the raw convention-specialist manifest, candidates, status, and artifact hash;
- immutable PR/source/target/change-set, config, script, prompt, policy, schema,
  convention-plan, and fact-plan bindings;
- normalized version-1 candidates and deterministic candidate hashes;
- sanitized thread facts, exact source-commit evidence hunks, convention sources,
  cluster membership, origins, and verifier assignments.

Replay reads this artifact and saved verifier records. It reconstructs cluster
IDs, ordering, eligibility, corrected severities, and withholding decisions
without rerunning discovery. Array shape is preserved for empty, singleton, and
multiple values; canonical JSON uses strict UTF-8, ordinal ordering, and invariant
numeric formatting.

## Clustering and assignments

Candidate clustering is wrapper-deterministic and advisory. Exact and near-exact
findings cluster by normalized claim and anchor. A bounded semantic pass groups
paraphrases and cross-file candidates only when issue class and behavior tokens
substantially overlap. File/line overlap alone never merges candidates. Originals
remain in the sealed input, and each cluster ID is the hash of its ordered member
hashes.

Generalist candidates discovered by Claude Opus 5 are assigned to GPT-5.6 Sol;
Sol candidates are assigned to Opus 5. Convention candidates use the explicitly
configured generalist verifier. A sole-origin candidate cannot verify itself.
Mixed-origin clusters are still evidence-checked; corroboration is not truth.

## Verifier boundary

Each verifier receives one cluster only: assigned candidates, bounded sibling
evidence, exact source-commit hunks, cited convention quote/provenance,
deterministic facts, and sanitized existing-thread evidence. It does not receive
discovery summaries, unrelated candidates, delivery state, or write tools.

`VERIFICATION_RESULT_V1` is nonce-bound and closed to `verified`, `duplicate`,
`unsupported`, `wrongSeverity`, and `needsHuman`. Every verdict binds the exact
candidate, cluster, source snapshot, verifier model, prompt, and evidence hash.
The schema has no comment, publication, write, summary, or vote fields.

Timeout, invalid marker, stale binding, model mismatch, tool violation, missing
evidence, incomplete output, disagreement, or `needsHuman` withholds. There is no
majority vote. Verification cannot add or expand a finding or raise severity.

## Eligibility and artifacts

Generalist eligibility requires an independent supported outcome and a valid
changed-file or PR-metadata anchor. Convention eligibility additionally rechecks
the exact source hash and quote, sibling requirement, deterministic fact states,
and existing-thread duplicates. A degraded specialist is recorded but cannot
remove independently verified generalist candidates.

Decision artifacts are `verification-decision-preview` manifests under
`verification-previews`. They include clusters/origins, assignments, verifier
models and prompt hashes, tool audit, decisions, withholding reasons, corrected
severity, source/fact/thread bindings, all input hashes, and final eligible
preview candidates. Input and decision artifacts derive different HMAC keys from
the reviewer master key. Delivery promotion accepts only the exact delivery
manifest key set and cannot authenticate either verification domain.
