# Bounded rule evaluation from active-PR intake

`tools/Invoke-BoundedRuleEvaluation.ps1` is a **separate, default-off,
read-only** scheduler-callable command. It does not register a task, enable
any service policy, post comments, vote, set statuses, update threads, or
send notifications. It leaves the pinned Owner and static read-only relation
cohorts and their attempts untouched. Relation has no writer or automatic
evaluation path here.

The command needs absolute external `-StateRoot`, `-IntakeConfigPath`, and
`-ConfigPath`. The intake configuration must be the exact configuration
used to create `active-pr-intake-v1/cohort.json`; the dispatcher checks its
SHA-256 binding, complete inventory, per-head declarations and changed-line
evidence, and byte-for-byte equality with the immutable generation. Intake's
two-pass ADO listing cannot provide an atomic server snapshot. Changed-line
proofs are necessary but **not rule evaluations**. A selected head without
complete line evidence is `unknown`, never `evaluated`. The intake timestamp
must be current (at most 120 minutes old in the sample), or dispatch fails
before reading ADO.

The sample [`rule-evaluation.config.json`](../samples/rule-evaluation.config.json)
has both global and per-capability switches disabled. To run an enabled
configuration, the operator supplies `DEVPILOT_RULE_EVALUATION_KEY` outside
the repository and an external `signature` of the form
`v1:hmac-sha256:<lowercase-hex>` over the UTF-8 bytes of
`ConvertTo-AgentCanonicalJson` of the configuration without `signature`.
Neither the key nor private ADO content belongs in the repository. There is
no implicit enablement through the intake setting or any existing signed
writer policy. `-Run` and a valid signature are both required. Disabled
invocations do not contact ADO or create durable dispatcher state.

At most 20 eligible master-target heads are selected per invocation, in
numeric-PR order with an atomic durable next-ID cursor. This includes old
PRs: on a stable 275-head eligible inventory, every head is offered a slot
within 14 cycles. Heads that change source, target, iteration, status, or
draft state between intake, pre-read, and post-read are unknown rather than
credited; failed reads and unavailable/over-budget evidence are separate
reasons. The cursor advances only with a committed immutable report, so a
crash before commit repeats a batch. An exclusive per-dispatcher file lock
prevents concurrent runs from sharing a cursor. Every run mints a fresh
generation under `rule-evaluation-v1/generations/`, and only observations
minted for that generation under `rule-evaluation-v1/observations/` can count
as evaluated. Previous generations never become current-head coverage,
even when the PR ID is the same. A newly changed head has to be read again.
The latest report is swapped atomically after observations and its immutable
generation are durable.

Each enabled rule receives its own new immutable
`rule-evaluation-v1/declarations/<digest>.json` with the generation,
intake declaration/line-proof digests, exact source/target/iteration,
configuration and per-rule cap. Each enabled deterministic capability
(class exclusion, redundant method
exclusion, and named `Assert.AreEqual` arguments) uses the repository's
bounded C# parsers against exact-commit source and changed spans. Its
immutable observation records the intake generation, exact source/target
commits, target ref, iteration, rule identity, rule declaration digest,
timestamp and aggregate outcome. The independent per-rule cap and global
cap both apply. Unknown
parser resolution or a cap excess cannot become a finding. Before recording
would-create counts, the command reuses the repository's ADO discussion
normalizer: duplicate comments are deduplicated; an unmarked same-account
comment is human, not automation. Any relevant but unresolvable discussion
leaves a finding unknown instead of claiming safe deduplication. These
counts are **read-only hypothetical outcomes**, never posting authority.
Source text and comment bodies are transient and are never written to the
cohort, observation, or normal log.

Owner requires a separately injected, trusted `-OwnerEvaluator` scriptblock;
the wrapper has **no built-in model launch or Owner enablement**. An
Owner-enabled configuration without that
adapter reports `owner-evaluator-unavailable`, not a fabricated evaluation.
An injected adapter must return a completed, source/target/iteration/intake
and new declaration-bound proof, its immutable manifest digest and entry
count (at most 32 and no more than this batch), and zero provider writes,
write-tool invocations and model tool invocations. The existing Owner
manifest and create cap remain separate and must be honored by that
adapter. No enabled Owner state from the pinned
service, static relation, task result zero, or discovery event is imported.
This limitation is deliberate: a real Owner evaluator must build an exact
new source/target/config-bound manifest and produce a verified completed
observation rather than treating a link or old state as execution.

The optional dashboard `roots.ruleEvaluation` /
`files.ruleEvaluationCohort` pair points to the private dispatcher root and
its `cohort.json`, respectively. The Rules view reports current-generation
scope, evaluated, pending, skipped, unknown, and errors separately from
the pinned canary history. Configuration of this optional feed does not
deploy the dispatcher.
